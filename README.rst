A Mac client to creating documentation for Sphinx.

Still in the alpha stages, but with some effort should be an amazing app.


Why Am I Doing This
===================


I really can't spell.  And I've been forced into using sphinx to manage a lot of my documentation (and admittedly it is very helpful for doing it).  However, I really wanted something a little bit more specific for the type of "rest" based editing that I needed to do.

Also, there are some cool new features like "versions" that come built in with 10.7 that it really seemed cool to try out on this. 

And finally, can you ever have to much to do?  Really what is another project to pour all my spare time into?
